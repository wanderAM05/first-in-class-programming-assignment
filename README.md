# Practica #1. Declaring Variables

In this assignment, you must declare all variables correctly so that the given code compiles and runs without errors.

## What to do
Open the file `variables.c`. This file currently has issues with variable declarations. To fix them, you must:

- Declare variables that are missing.
- Correct improperly declared variables.
- Remove variables that are declared but never used.

## Where to modify
Only edit the variable declaration section in `variables.c`. This section is clearly marked with a comment. Do not change any other code outside this section.

Please do not modify any other files.

## **Testing Your Program**

The Makefile provided includes several test cases. You can test each case like...

  ```plaintext
  make test1
  ```
You can test all of them at once by...
  ```plaintext
  make testall
  ```
If the make file returns no error, your program passed the test.
Feel free to create more custom test cases as well.

## **Submission Requirements**

The ONLY file you need to submit to gradescope is:
`variables.c`
